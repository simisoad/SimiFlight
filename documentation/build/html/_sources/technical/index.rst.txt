Overview
========

SimiFlight implements several advanced technical concepts to achieve its goals:

.. _hybrid-precision-world:

Hybrid Precision World
---------------------

A dual-coordinate system approach that enables planetary-scale simulation:

* Local rendering in standard engine coordinates
* Global positioning using 64-bit precision
* Floating origin system for stable physics

.. _godot-modifications:

Godot Engine Modifications
-------------------------

Customizations to the Godot Engine to support SimiFlight's requirements:

* Custom Godot build with 64-bit support
* GPU precision workarounds
* Performance optimizations

.. _flight-physics:

Flight Physics Engine
-------------------

A sophisticated physics system that models realistic flight:

* Four core forces: lift, drag, weight, and thrust
* Multiple control points for realistic force application
* Aerodynamic tables based on angle of attack and Mach number

.. _curve-tool:

Curve Tool
---------

A specialized tool for generating aerodynamic data:

* Lift/drag curve generation
* Variable angle of attack and Mach number calculations
* Semi-empirical and panel method approaches

.. _godot-python:

Godot-Python Integration
----------------------

Integration between Godot and Python for enhanced functionality:

* External process communication
* HTTP API for real-time data exchange
* Aerodynamic modeling through Python libraries

Technical Implementation
=======================

The technical implementation of SimiFlight follows these principles:

* **Modular design** - Components can be developed and tested independently
* **Performance optimization** - Critical systems written in C++ for speed
* **Validation** - Physics models compared against real-world data
* **Scalability** - Systems designed to handle planetary-scale simulation
