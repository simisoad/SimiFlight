Personal Background
===================

The SimiFlight project stems from a lifelong passion for aviation and simulation technology.

Name Origin
-----------

The name "SimiFlight" derives from "Simi," which is Luzerner dialect for "Simon" - 
reflecting the personal connection to the project's creator.

Inspiration
-----------

SimiFlight draws inspiration from several sources:

* A **lifelong passion for aviation** and flight simulation
* Experience building a **physical flight simulator prototype** for a Matura thesis
* A desire to create a simulator that balances realism with accessibility

Physics Preference
------------------

The project's approach to physics reflects a specific philosophy:

* Embracing **realistic flight dynamics** (similar to DCS World)
* Avoiding **overwhelming complexity** that detracts from the flying experience
* Creating systems that are authentic but approachable

Spherical World Model
---------------------

A core principle of SimiFlight is the implementation of a spherical world model:

* A deliberate **rejection of flat Earth** approaches in flight simulations
* Inspired by games like **Kerbal Space Program** and **Outerra**
* Commitment to scientific accuracy balanced with technical feasibility


Project Goals
=============

SimiFlight aims to create an experience that:

* Makes flying realistic but accessible
* Provides a scientifically accurate world model
* Balances simulation depth with enjoyable gameplay
* Creates a modular system that can grow over time
