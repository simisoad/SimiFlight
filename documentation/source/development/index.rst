Overview
========

SimiFlight is being developed as a modular project with several interconnected components.
This section describes the development approach, tools, and structure.

.. _development-approach:

Development Approach
------------------

The development of SimiFlight follows these core principles:

* **Modular design** - Components are developed with clean interfaces
* **Physics-first** - Focus on accurate flight dynamics as the foundation
* **Progressive enhancement** - Start with core features and enhance over time
* **Open development** - Clear documentation and structured approach

.. _development-tools-overview:

Development Tools
---------------

SimiFlight development relies on several specialized tools:

* **Modified Godot Engine 4.4** - Customized for 64-bit precision
* **Python ecosystem** - For aerodynamic modeling and external tools
* **C++ extensions** - For performance-critical components
* **Version control** - Git-based workflow with feature branches

For more detailed information, see :doc:`tools`.

.. _repository-structure-overview:

Repository Structure
------------------

The project is organized into a clear repository structure:

* **Main Godot project** - Core simulation engine and gameplay
* **CurveTool** - Specialized tool for aerodynamic data generation
* **Python utilities** - Shared code for mathematical modeling
* **Assets** - Models, textures, and sounds
* **Documentation** - User guides and API references

For details on the repository organization, see :doc:`structure`.

.. _development-roadmap-overview:

Development Roadmap
-----------------

SimiFlight's development follows a strategic roadmap:

1. **Prototype Curve Tool** - Python backend + Godot UI
2. **Physics Core** - Implement forces, load curve data, test in 3D
3. **Spherical World** - Integrate 64-bit coordinates and floating origin
4. **Optimization** - Port physics to C++, profile performance
5. **Gameplay Systems** - Add missions, challenges, and assists
6. **Documentation** - Write user guides, example scenes, and API references

For the complete development timeline, see :doc:`roadmap`.

Contributing
===========

Contributions to SimiFlight are welcome in several areas:

* **Aircraft models** - Creating new aircraft with realistic flight characteristics
* **Flight physics** - Enhancing the aerodynamic model
* **Terrain systems** - Improving the planetary rendering
* **Gameplay mechanics** - Developing missions and challenges
* **Documentation** - Expanding guides and examples

Development Environment Setup
===========================

To set up a development environment for SimiFlight:

1. Clone the repository with submodules
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Build the custom Godot engine
4. Set up the Python environment with required packages
5. Import the project in the Godot editor

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/username/simiflight.git
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   cd simiflight/Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Build custom Godot (see detailed instructions in documentation)

Best Practices
============

Development follows these best practices:

* **Code style** - Consistent formatting and naming
* **Documentation** - Comprehensive comments and external docs
* **Testing** - Unit tests for critical components
* **Performance** - Regular profiling and optimization
* **Modular design** - Clean interfaces between components
