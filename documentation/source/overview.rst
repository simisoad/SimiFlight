Vision & Project Overview
========================

SimiFlight is a modular flight simulator being developed with **Godot Engine 4.4** that aims
to strike a balance between realistic physics and sandbox-style exploration.

Core Goal
---------

Build a flight simulator that combines:

* Realistic aerodynamics and physics
* A scientifically accurate spherical world model
* Accessible gameplay that doesn't require extensive aviation knowledge

Key Balance
-----------

SimiFlight seeks to balance:

* **Physical realism** - including accurate aerodynamics and a spherical world model
* **Casual gameplay** - avoiding overly complex cockpit systems and procedures

Long-Term Vision
---------------

The long-term vision for SimiFlight includes:

* A complete flight simulation on a **scientifically accurate spherical planet**
* Scalable technical solutions like 64-bit coordinates and floating origin systems
* Progressive levels of realism that users can adjust to their preferences

Technologies
-----------

SimiFlight leverages several technologies:

* **Godot Engine** - Modified for 64-bit precision
* **C++ GDExtensions** - For performance-critical physics calculations
* **Python 3.x** - For aerodynamic curve generation and external tools
