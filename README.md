# SimiFlight

SimiFlight is an open-source project designed to provide tools for simulating flight physics, specifically for aircraft dynamics and flight simulation in a 3D environment. The project is developed in Godot and Python, and it aims to offer a realistic and interactive flight simulation experience. 

## Project Structure

- **simiflight-curvetool**: Contains tools for generating and managing flight dynamics curves (Lift, Drag, etc.). 
- **Godot**: The main flight simulation GUI and logic are built using Godot Engine, supporting physics-based simulations.
- **Python**: External Python scripts for advanced calculations, such as curve generation and physics-based modeling.

## Features

- **Flight Physics**: Realistic flight dynamics based on physical principles, including Lift, Drag, and Thrust.
- **Curves Generation**: Tools for generating Lift/Drag curves to be used in the simulation.
- **Customizable Aircraft Models**: Users can create custom aircraft with different aerodynamic properties.
- **Simulation Control**: The project allows for real-time adjustments to aircraft parameters and simulation settings.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimiFlight.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the Godot and Python components.

3. Navigate to the respective folders for Godot and Python to start using the tools.

## Getting Started with the Curvetool

The `simiflight-curvetool` directory contains the tools for generating Lift and Drag curves based on aerodynamic parameters. Follow the instructions in the respective README inside the folder to get started.
