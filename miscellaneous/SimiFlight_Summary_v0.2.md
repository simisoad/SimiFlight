# SimiFlight ‚Äì Project Overview (Combined Summary)
**Version:** 0.1 ‚Ä¢ Initial draft, expanded

## Vision & Project Overview  
- **Core Goal**: Build a modular flight simulator ("SimiFlight") in **Godot Engine 4.4** that blends realistic physics with sandbox-style exploration.  
- **Key Balance**: Physical realism (e.g., aerodynamics, spherical world) paired with casual gameplay (no complex cockpit systems).  
- **Long-Term Vision**: Simulate flight on a **scientifically accurate spherical planet** using scalable technical solutions like 64-bit coordinates and floating origin systems.  
- **Technologies**:  
  - Godot Engine (modified for 64-bit precision).  
  - C++ GDExtensions for performance-critical physics.  
  - Python 3.x for aerodynamic curve generation and external tools.

## Personal Motivation  
- **Name Origin**: ‚ÄúSimiFlight‚Äù derives from ‚ÄúSimi‚Äù (Luzerner dialect for ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù).  
- **Inspiration**: Lifelong aviation passion + experience building a physical flight simulator prototype for a Matura thesis.  
- **Physics Preference**: Realistic flight dynamics (e.g., DCS World) without overwhelming complexity.  
- **Spherical World**: A rejection of flat Earth in simulations; inspired by *Kerbal Space Program* and *Outerra*.

## Goals  

### Realism  
- Physics-based flight model: Lift, drag, G-forces, stalling, Mach effects (Prandtl-Glauert correction up to Mach 0.85).  
- Modular realism: Toggle simplified controls, auto-trim, wind effects, etc.  
- Focus on **flying**, not cockpit procedures (no cold-start simulations).  

### World & Scale  
- **Full spherical planet** with terrain streaming.  
- **64-bit floating-point precision** for global positioning.  
- Floating origin technique to mitigate precision errors.  
- Dynamic LOD (level of detail) and object culling.  

### Gameplay  
- Hybrid ‚Äúsim-lite‚Äù experience: Mix simulator rigor with arcade freedom.  
- Exploration, missions, races, or delivery systems.  
- Optional assists: Simplified physics, AI traffic, HUD guides.

## Technical Concepts  

### 1. Hybrid Precision World  
- Local rendering in standard engine coordinates.  
- Global positioning in `float64` for planetary-scale accuracy.  
- Floating origin system for stable physics far from the origin.  

### 2. Godot Engine Modifications  
- Custom Godot build with 64-bit support.  
- Workarounds for GPU double-precision limitations (shader hacks, fixed-function fallbacks).  

### 3. Flight Physics Engine  
- **Core Forces**: Lift, drag, weight, thrust (applied at wing control points).  
- **Data Input**: Precomputed aerodynamic tables (angle of attack, Mach number).  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Prototype in GDScript, optimize via C++ GDExtensions.  
  - Multi-threading for performance-critical tasks.  

### 4. Curve Tool (Aerodynamic Modeling)  
- **Purpose**: Generate lift/drag curves for airfoils under variable angles of attack and Mach numbers.  
- **Methods**:  
  - Semi-empirical model (thin airfoil theory + stall corrections).  
  - Panel method for 2D potential flow.  
- **Integration**:  
  - Python scripts called by Godot via HTTP (Flask/FastAPI) or process execution.  
  - Godot UI built with `@tool` scripts for editor-driven design.  

### 5. Godot-Python Integration  
- **Workflows**:  
  - External process calls (Godot ‚Üî Python stdout).  
  - HTTP API for real-time data exchange.

## Development Tools  
- **Godot Engine**: Customized for planetary rendering and 64-bit physics.  
- **Python**: Aerodynamic modeling, curve generation, and external tools.  
- **C++**: GDExtensions for high-performance physics.  
- **GitHub**: Hosting for `simiflight` repository with sub-projects.  
- **Documentation**: Markdown (PyCharm + GitHub).
